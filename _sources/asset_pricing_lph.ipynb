    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is about  some implications of  asset-pricing theories that are based on the equation\n",
    "$E m R = 1,$ where $R$ is the gross return on an asset, $m$ is  a stochastic discount factor, and $E$ is a mathematical expectation with respect to a joint probability distribution of $R$ and $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of this equation occur in  many models. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Chapter 1 of {cite}`Ljungqvist2012` describes the role that this equation plays in a diverse set of\n",
    "models in macroeconomics, monetary economics, and public finance.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to convey insights about empirical implications of this equation brought out in the work of Lars Peter Hansen {cite}`HansenRichard1987` and Lars Peter Hansen and Ravi Jagannathan {cite}`Hansen_Jagannathan_1991`. \n",
    "\n",
    "By following their footsteps, from  that single equation  we'll derive \n",
    "\n",
    "* a mean-variance frontier \n",
    "\n",
    "* a single-factor model of  excess  returns  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we use two ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * the equation $E m R =1 $ that is  implied by an application of a *law of one price*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * a Cauchy-Schwartz inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll apply a Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to a population linear least squares regression equation that is\n",
    "implied by $E m R =1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also describe how  practitioners have implemented the model using\n",
    "\n",
    "* cross sections of returns on many assets\n",

    "{cite}`HansenRichard1987` and {cite}`Hansen_Jagannathan_1991` explain how **existence** of a scalar stochastic discount factor that verifies  equation\n",

    "factor $m \\geq 0$.\n",

    "In order to say something about the **uniqueness** of a stochastic discount factor, we  would have to impose more theoretical structure than we do in this\n",

    "## Implications of Key Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine  key equation {eq}`eq:EMR1` with a  remark of Lars Peter Hansen that   \"asset pricing theory is all about covariances\".\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do this step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First note  that the definition of a\n",
    "covariance \n",
    "$\\operatorname{cov}\\left(m, R^{i}\\right)  =  E (m - E m)(R^i - E R^i) $\n",

    "$$\n",
