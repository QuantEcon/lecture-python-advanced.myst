    "\n",
    "This lecture is about  some implications of  asset-pricing theories that are based on the equation\n",
    "$E m R = 1,$ where $R$ is the gross return on an asset, $m$ is  a stochastic discount factor, and $E$ is a mathematical expectation with respect to a joint probability distribution of $R$ and $m$.\n",

    "Instances of this equation occur in  many models.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Chapter 1 of {cite}`Ljungqvist2012` describes the role that this equation plays in a diverse set of\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  * the equation $E m R =1 $ that is  implied by an application of a *law of one price*\n",
