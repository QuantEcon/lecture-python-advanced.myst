    "\n",
    "The most fruitful way to think about solutions to discrete DP problems is to compare *policies*.\n",

    "\n",
    "* $a_t = \\sigma(s_t)$ indicates that $a_t$ is the action to be taken in state $s_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that, for any arbitrary policy, there exists a stationary Markov policy that dominates it at least weakly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* See section 5.5 of {cite}`puterman2005` for discussion and proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, stationary Markov policies are referred to simply as policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to find an optimal policy, in the sense of one that maximizes {eq}`dp_objective`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now step through these ideas more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a discrete dynamic program consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A finite set of *states* $S = \\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n",
    "1. A finite set of *feasible actions* $A(s)$ for each state $s \\in S$, and a corresponding set of *feasible state-action pairs*.\n",

    "1. A *transition probability function* $Q\\colon \\mathit{SA} \\to \\Delta(S)$, where $\\Delta(S)$ is the set of probability distributions over $S$.\n",
    "1. A *discount factor* $\\beta \\in [0, 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the notation $A := \\bigcup_{s \\in S} A(s) = \\{0, \\ldots, m-1\\}$ and call this set the *action space*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *policy* is a function $\\sigma\\colon S \\to A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A policy is called *feasible* if it satisfies $\\sigma(s) \\in A(s)$ for all $s \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote the set of all feasible policies by $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a decision-maker uses  a policy $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$, then\n",

    "### Value Function Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most familiar method for solving all manner of dynamic programs is value function iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm uses the fact that the Bellman operator $T$ is a contraction mapping with fixed point $v^*$.\n",

    "Hence, iterative application of $T$ to any initial function $v^0 \\colon S \\to \\mathbb R$ converges to $v^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the algorithm can be found in {ref}`the appendix <ddp_algorithms>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy Function Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This routine, also known as Howard's policy improvement algorithm, exploits more closely the particular structure of a discrete DP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration consists of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A policy evaluation step that computes the value $v_{\\sigma}$ of a policy $\\sigma$ by solving the linear equation $v = T_{\\sigma} v$.\n",
    "1. A policy improvement step that computes a $v_{\\sigma}$-greedy policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current setting, policy iteration computes an exact optimal policy in finitely many iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* See theorem 10.2.6 of [EDTC](http://johnstachurski.net/edtc.html) for a proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the algorithm can be found in {ref}`the appendix <ddp_algorithms>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified Policy Function Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified policy iteration replaces the policy evaluation step in policy iteration with \"partial policy evaluation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter computes an approximation to the value of a policy $\\sigma$ by iterating $T_{\\sigma}$ for a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be useful when the state space is very large and the linear system in the policy evaluation step of policy iteration is correspondingly difficult to solve.\n",
