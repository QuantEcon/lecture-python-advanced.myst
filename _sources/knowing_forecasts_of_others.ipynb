    "Robert E. Lucas, Jr. {cite}`lucas75`, Kenneth Kasa  {cite}`kasa`, and Robert Townsend\n",

    "variables from equilibrium prices and quantities can\n",
    "elongate and amplify impulse responses to aggregate\n",
    "shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a promising way to think about amplification mechanisms  in business cycle models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Townsend {cite}`townsend`\n",
    "noted  that living in  such environments   makes decision makers  want  to forecast  forecasts of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theme has been pursued  for situations in which\n",
    "decision makers' imperfect information forces them to pursue an\n",
    "infinite recursion that involves forming beliefs about the beliefs of others\n",
    "(e.g., {cite}`ams`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucas {cite}`lucas75` side stepped having decision makers forecast the\n",
    "forecasts of other decision makers by assuming that they simply **pool their\n",
    "information** before forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **pooling equilibrium** like Lucas's plays a prominent role in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because he didn’t assume such pooling, {cite}`townsend`\n",
    "confronted the forecasting the forecasts of others problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate the  problem recursively required that Townsend define a decision maker's **state** vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Townsend concluded that his original  model required an intractable infinite dimensional  state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, he constructed a more manageable approximating model in which a hidden Markov component of\n",
    "a demand shock is\n",
    "revealed to all firms after a fixed,  finite number of periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we illustrate again the theme that **finding the state is an art** by\n",
    "showing how to formulate Townsend's original model in terms of a low-dimensional state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We show that Townsend's model shares equilibrium prices and quantities with those   that\n",
    "prevail in a pooling equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "That finding emerged from a line of research about  Townsend's model that   built on {cite}`PCL` and that  culminated in\n",
    "{cite}`Pearlman_Sargent2005` .\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than directly deploying the {cite}`PCL` machinery here, we shall instead implement a  sneaky\n",
    "**guess-and-verify** tactic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We first compute a pooling equilibrium and represent it as an instance of  a linear  state-space system provided by\n",
    "  the Python class `quantecon.LinearStateSpace`.\n",
    "* Leaving the state-transition equation for the pooling equilibrium unaltered, we alter the observation vector\n",
    "  for a firm to match what it is in Townsend's original model. So rather than directly observing the signal received by\n",
    "  firms in the other industry, a firm sees the equilibrium price\n",
    "  of the good produced by the other industry.\n",
    "* We compute a population linear least squares regression of the noisy signal at time $t$ that firms in the other\n",
    "  industry would  receive in a pooling equilibrium on time $t$ information that a firm receives in Townsend's\n",
    "  original model.\n",
    "* The $R^2$ in this regression equals $1$.\n",

    "The models are simplified versions   of Townsend's  {cite}`townsend`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Townsend's is a model of a rational expectations equilibrium in which firms want to **forecast  forecasts of others**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Townsend's model, firms condition  their forecasts on observed endogenous variables whose equilibrium laws of motion\n",
    "are determined by their own forecasting functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall  assemble model  components progressively in  ways that can help us to appreciate the structure of the\n",
    "**pooling equilibrium**  that ultimately interests us.\n",
    "\n",
    "While keeping all other aspects of the model the same, we shall study\n",
    "consequences of alternative assumptions about what decision makers\n",
