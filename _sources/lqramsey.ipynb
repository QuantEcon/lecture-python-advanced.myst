    "In this lecture, we study optimal fiscal policy in a linear quadratic setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We modify a model of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey {cite}`LucasStokey1983` so that convenient formulas for\n",
    "solving linear-quadratic models can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy consists of a representative household and a benevolent government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government finances an exogenous stream of government purchases with state-contingent loans and a linear tax on labor income.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear tax is sometimes called a flat-rate tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The household maximizes utility by choosing paths for consumption and labor, taking prices and the government's tax rate and borrowing plans as given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum attainable utility for the household depends on the government's tax and borrowing plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Ramsey problem* {cite}`Ramsey1927` is  to choose tax and borrowing plans that maximize the household's welfare, taking the household's optimizing behavior as given.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large number of competitive equilibria indexed by different government fiscal policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ramsey planner chooses the best competitive equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to study  the dynamics of tax rates,  tax revenues, government debt under a Ramsey plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Lucas and Stokey model features state-contingent government debt, the government debt dynamics differ substantially from those in a model of Robert Barro {cite}`Barro1979`.\n",
