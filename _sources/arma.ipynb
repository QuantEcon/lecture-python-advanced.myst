    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we study covariance stationary linear stochastic processes, a\n",
    "class of models routinely used to study economic and financial time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class has the advantage of being\n",
    "\n",
    "1. simple enough to be described by an elegant and comprehensive theory\n",
    "1. relatively broad in terms of the kinds of dynamics it can represent\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider these models in both the time and frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### {index}`ARMA Processes <single: ARMA Processes>`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus much of our attention on linear covariance stationary models with a finite number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will study stationary ARMA processes, which form a cornerstone of the standard theory of time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every ARMA process can be represented in [linear state space](https://python-intro.quantecon.org/linear_models.html) form.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ARMA processes have some important structure that makes it valuable to study them separately.\n",

    "### {index}`Spectral Analysis <single: Spectral Analysis>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis in the frequency domain is also called spectral analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, spectral analysis provides an alternative representation of the\n",
    "autocovariance function of a covariance stationary process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a second representation of this important object\n",
    "\n",
    "* shines a light on the dynamics of the process in question\n",
    "* allows for a simpler, more tractable representation in some important cases\n",

    "Thus, $\\{ X_t \\}$ begins in the infinite past and extends to the infinite future --- a convenient and standard assumption.\n",

    "As in other fields, successful economic modeling typically assumes the existence of features that are constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these assumptions are correct, then each new observation $X_t, X_{t+1},\\ldots$ can provide additional information about the time-invariant features, allowing us to  learn from as data arrive.\n",

    "The function $\\gamma \\colon \\mathbb Z \\to \\mathbb R$ is called the *autocovariance function* of the process.\n",
