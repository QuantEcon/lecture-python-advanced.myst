    "# Machine Learning a Ramsey Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This  lecture  uses what we call a ``machine learning`` approach to \n",
    "compute a Ramsey plan  for  a version of a model of Calvo {cite}`Calvo1978`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use another approach to compute a  Ramsey plan for Calvo's model  in another quantecon lecture\n",
    "{doc}`calvo`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The {doc}`calvo` lecture  uses  an analytic approach based on ``dynamic programming squared`` to guide computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming squared provides  information about the structure of  mathematical  objects in terms of which a Ramsey plan can be represented recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using that information  paves the way to computing a  Ramsey plan efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Included in the structural information  that dynamic programming squared provides  in quantecon lecture {doc}`calvo`  are \n",
    "\n",
    "  * a **state** variable that confronts a continuation Ramsey planner, and \n",
    "  * two **Bellman equations**\n",
    "    * one that describes the behavior of the representative agent\n",
    "    * another that describes  decision problems of a Ramsey planner and of a continuation Ramsey planner  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we approach the Ramsey planner in a less sophisticated way that proceeds without knowing the mathematical  structure imparted by dynamic programming squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply choose a pair of infinite sequences of real numbers that maximizes a Ramsey planner's objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pair  consists of \n",
    "\n",
    "* a sequence $\\vec \\theta$ of inflation rates \n",
    "* a sequence $\\vec \\mu$ of money growh rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it fails to take advantage of the structure recognized by dynamic programming squared and, relative to the dynamic programming squared approach, proliferates parameters, we take the liberty of calling this a **machine learning** approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to what other machine learning algorithms also do.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the calculations in this lecture with those in our sister lecture {doc}`calvo` provides us\n",
    "with a laboratory that can  help us  appreciate promises and limits of machine learning approaches\n",
    "more generally. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll actually deploy two machine learning approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    " * the first is really lazy \n",
    "    * it  writes  a Python function that   computes the Ramsey planner's objective as a function of a money growth rate sequence and  hands it over to a ``gradient descent`` optimizer\n",
    " * the second is less lazy\n",
    "     * it exerts enough  mental effort required to express the Ramsey planner's objective as an affine quadratic form in $\\vec \\mu$, computes first-order conditions for an optimum, arranges them into a system of simultaneous linear  equations for $\\vec \\mu$ and then $\\vec \\theta$, then solves them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of  these machine learning (ML) approaches  recovers the same  Ramsey plan that we compute  in  quantecon lecture {doc}`calvo` by using dynamic programming squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "However,   the recursive structure of the Ramsey plan lies hidden within   some of the objects calculated  by our ML approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To  ferret out that structure, we have to ask   the right questions.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "We pose  some of  those questions at the end of this lecture and  answer them  by running  some  linear  regressions on components of $\\vec \\mu, \\vec \\theta,$ and another vector that we'll define later.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Human intelligence, not the ``artificial intelligence`` deployed in our machine learning approach, is a key input into choosing which regressions to run. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We study a   linear-quadratic version of a model that Guillermo Calvo {cite}`Calvo1978` used to illustrate the **time inconsistency** of optimal government plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Calvo's model focuses  on intertemporal tradeoffs between\n",
    "\n",
    "- utility accruing from  a representative  agent's anticipations of future  deflation that lower the agent's  cost of holding real money balances and prompt him to  increase his   *liquidity*, as  measured by his   stock  of real money balances, and\n",
    "- social costs associated with the  distorting taxes that a government  levies  to acquire the paper money that it   destroys  in order to generate prospective deflation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model features\n",
    "\n",
    "- rational expectations\n",
    "- costly government actions at all dates $t \\geq 1$ that increase the representative agent's  utilities at dates before $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model combines ideas from  papers by Cagan {cite}`Cagan`, {cite}`sargent1973stability`,  and  Calvo {cite}`Calvo1978`.\n",
