    "- welfare benefits that anticipations of future  deflation generate  by decreasing  costs of holding real money balances and thereby increasing a representative agent’s *liquidity*, as measured by his or her holdings of real money balances, and  \n",

    "- sets of Bellman equations, one set for each timing protocol  \n",
    "  - for example, in a timing protocol used to pose a **Ramsey plan**, a government chooses an infinite sequence of money supply growth rates once and for all at time $ 0 $.  \n",
    "  - in this timing protocol, there are  two value functions and associated Bellman equations, one that expresses a representative  private expectation of future inflation as a function of current and future government actions, another that describes  the value function of a  Ramsey planner  \n",
