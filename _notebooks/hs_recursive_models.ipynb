    "### Overview of the Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In saying that “complete markets are all alike”, Robert E. Lucas, Jr. was noting  that all of them have\n",
    "\n",
    "- a commodity space.  \n",
    "- a space dual to the commodity space in which prices reside.  \n",
    "- endowments of resources.  \n",
    "- peoples’ preferences over goods.  \n",
    "- physical technologies for transforming resources into goods.  \n",
    "- random processes that govern shocks to technologies and preferences and associated information flows.  \n",
    "- a single budget constraint per person.  \n",
    "- the existence of a representative consumer even when there are many people in the model.  \n",
    "- a concept of competitive equilibrium.  \n",
    "- theorems connecting competitive equilibrium allocations to allocations that would be chosen by a benevolent social planner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The models have **no frictions** such as $ \\ldots $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforcement difficulties  \n",
    "- Information asymmetries  \n",
    "- Other forms of transactions costs  \n",
    "- Externalities  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The models extensively use the  powerful ideas of\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing commodities and their prices by time (John R. Hicks).  \n",
    "- Indexing commodities and their prices by chance (Kenneth Arrow).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of  the imperialism of complete markets models comes from applying these two tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hicks trick of indexing commodities by time is the idea that **dynamics are a special case of statics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arrow trick of indexing commodities by chance is the idea that **analysis of trade under uncertainty is a special\n",
    "case of the analysis of trade under certainty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [[HS13](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id71)] class of models specify the commodity space, preferences, technologies, stochastic shocks and information flows in ways\n",
