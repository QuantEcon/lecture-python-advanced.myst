    "Firms have incentives to innovate and produce new goods when the mass of varieties of goods currently in production is relatively low.\n",

    "This leads to temporal clustering in innovations in each country.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, goods also become obsolete, so that not all survive from period to period.\n",
