    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Complete markets* allow a consumer  to buy and sell claims contingent on all possible states of the world.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hall [[Hal78](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id152)] worked in an incomplete markets tradition by assuming\n",
    "that the only asset that can be traded is a risk-free one-period bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hall assumed an exogenous stochastic process of nonfinancial income and\n",
    "an exogenous and time-invariant gross interest rate on one-period risk-free debt that equals\n",
    "$ \\beta^{-1} $, where $ \\beta \\in (0,1) $ is also a consumer’s\n",
    "intertemporal discount factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to saying that  it costs $ \\beta $ of  time $ t $ consumption to buy one unit of\n",
    "consumption at time $ t+1 $ for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So $ \\beta $ is the price of a one-period risk-free claim to consumption next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "We preserve Hall’s assumption about the interest rate when we describe an\n",
    "incomplete markets version of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we extend Hall’s assumption about the risk-free interest rate to an appropriate counterpart when we create another model in which there are markets\n",
    "in a complete array of one-period Arrow state-contingent securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll consider two closely related  alternative assumptions about the consumer’s\n",
    "exogenous nonfinancial income process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- that it is generated by  a finite $ N $ state Markov chain (setting $ N=2 $ most of the time in this lecture)  \n",

    "  state vector in $ {\\mathbb R}^n $ driven by a Gaussian vector IID shock\n",
    "  process  \n",
    "\n",
