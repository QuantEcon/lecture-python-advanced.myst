    "\n",
    "The economy consists of a representative household and a benevolent government.\n",
    "\n",

    "A linear tax is sometimes called a flat-rate tax.\n",

    "The household maximizes utility by choosing paths for consumption and labor, taking prices and the government’s tax rate and borrowing plans as given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum attainable utility for the household depends on the government’s tax and borrowing plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Ramsey problem* [[Ram27](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id194)] is  to choose tax and borrowing plans that maximize the household’s welfare, taking the household’s optimizing behavior as given.\n",

    "There is a large number of competitive equilibria indexed by different government fiscal policies.\n",
